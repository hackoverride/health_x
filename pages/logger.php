/*
    IDEAS:
        1. I want the users to create items and meals themselves. I dont like the loseit app with pre-set breakfast/lunch etc.
        2. I need to be able to sort the items, so first add items, then sort them by "meal"
        3. here I need to use session ids to add to meals. press the "done" button to remove the session meal id.
*/

/* 
    Check what is already created on this day.

*/

/*
    List items that are added with the new "meal" id tag in session

*/

/*
    Create the input adder for each item. (needed: )
    varenavn id, total gram. I need to calculate the total kcal from there.
    $_SESSION["currentMeal"]["item1"] = array(
        "varenavn" = id,
        "gram" = gram,
        "kcal" = kcal,
    );
